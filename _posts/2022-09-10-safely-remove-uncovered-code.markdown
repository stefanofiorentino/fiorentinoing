What if part of your codebase cannot be covered by tests?

If a line of code is not reachable by testing the public APIs of your system or library, chances are you didnâ€™t apply test-driven development well (or at all).

Do yourself a favour and (safely) remove the code.

Clarification: by "cannot be covered" I don't mean "is not covered".
