I'm lately experiencing the serial review and merge to trunk.

Serially addition of value over parallel conflicting WIPs.

So, we're currently pairing and even mobbing to get PRs rebased, reviewed, approved and merged together at once.

I know there is a flaw in doing this because maybe we started too late, but as we had several independent work in progress, outcomes are already showing this is the right way to go.

In the near future, we'll experiment this setup during the whole software development process.
